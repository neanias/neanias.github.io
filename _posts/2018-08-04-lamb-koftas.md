## Ingredients

* 500g lamb mince
* 2 tsp ground cumin
* Chilli flakes, to taste
* 2 tbsp chopped parsley leaves
* 2 tbsp chopped mint leaves
* Salt
* Pepper

## Method

1. Mix together all ingredients until well blended.
2. Roll the lamb mixture into pieces the size of golf balls and flatten them into patties about 1
   cm thick. Place on a plate drizzled with a little olive oil, and drizzle the tops of the patties
   with more oil, ready for cooking. Cover and chill for about 10 minutes to firm up.
3. Cook on a griddle or in a frying pan at a medium-high heat until both sides are well browned.
4. Serve with pitta bread and houmous (tzatziki and chilli sauce also work well).

Here's what they look like whilst I'm cooking them:

cooked side, should be much darker brown.")
