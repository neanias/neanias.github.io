## Ingredients

* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 4 rashers smoked streaky bacon, finely chopped
* 2 medium onions, finely chopped
* 2 carrots, trimmed and finely chopped
* 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
* 2-3 sprigs rosemary, leaves picked and finely chopped
* 500g beef mince
* 2 x 400g tins plum tomatoes (normal tinned tomatoes also work)
* small handful basil, leaves picked, 3/4 finely chopped and the rest left whole for garnish
* 1 tsp dried oregano
* 2 fresh bay leaves
* 2 tbsp tomato purée
* 1 beef stock cube
* 1 red chilli, seeded and finely chopped (optional, crushed chillis/chilli powder also works)
* 125ml red wine (rough measurement)
* 6 cherry tomatoes, sliced in half

## Method

1. Put a large heavy-based saucepan on a medium heat and add 1 tbsp olive oil. Add the bacon and
   fry for 10 mins until golden and crisp. Reduce the heat and add the onion, carrot, garlic and
   rosemary then fry for 10 mins, stirring often, until the veg has softened. 
2. Increase the heat to medium-high, add the mince and cook stirring for 3-4 mins until the meat is
   browned all over.
3. Add the tinned tomatoes, chopped basil, oregano, bay leaves, tomato purée, stock cube, chilli,
   wine and cherry tomatoes. Stir with a wooden spoon, breaking up the plum tomatoes (if using).
   Bring to the boil, reduce to a gentle simmer and cover with a lid. Cook for 1 hr 15 mins
   stirring occasionally, until you have a rich, thick sauce. Add parmesan, check the seasoning and
   stir.
4. When the Bolognese is nearly finished cook the spaghetti following pack instructions. Drain the
   spaghetti and stir into the Bolognese sauce. Serve with grated Parmesan the extra basil leaves
   and crusty bread, if you like.
